rpmbuild命令：
rpmbuild --showrc
rpmbuild --define "_topdir path" -bb *.specs


Per-User: By configuring the RPM topdir in $HOME/.rpmmacros

%_topdir    $HOME/rpmbuild


Per-Project: By configuring the RPM topdir in the Makefile or on the command line

rpmbuild --define '_topdir build' -ba package.spec
Note: in both cases, you will need to make sure your topdir directory has the appropriate directories (BUILD, SRPM, RPM, SPECS and SOURCES)
